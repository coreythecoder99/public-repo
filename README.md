# Cloud Dev & Programming Projects

## Welcome to my repository! 

This repo is a collection of all the cloud development and programming projects I've created, showcasing my experience and hands-on work with various cloud platforms and technologies. Projects in this repository span across Terraform, Docker, Kafka, AWS, Azure, and GCP, highlighting automation, infrastructure-as-code, containerization, and cloud-native solutions. Each project is a practical example of how these technologies can be leveraged to solve real-world challenges in modern cloud environments. Feel free to explore the code, learn from the implementations, and contribute if you're interested in cloud computing and DevOps!
